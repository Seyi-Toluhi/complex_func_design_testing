Thank you for apologizing when Iâ€™m too stubborn to do so. Thank you for taking situations that I come to you all worked up about, and laying them out for me in this wonderful, logical way that makes everything more clear. Thank you for listening to me and my occasional rants. Thank you for making me laugh when I need it most. Thank you for my new phone ðŸ“± because it was made possible because of you. Thank you for loving my body the way it is, for never making me feel inadequate, but rather perfect for you. Thank you for being on my side when it feels like no one else is. Thank you for making me feel safe."
